A lightweight half-edge data structure.

Best used with glm and glow.

## TODO

* Properties
* Algorithms
* Loader/Writer
* Tests
* std::less and std::hash for _index (and maybe _handle)
* attribute transformations (also between different types)
* lambda to attribute (from attribute to attribute or from make_attribute to attribute)
* Debug: store compactify generation in handles to check for invalidation
* Debug: insert is_removed assertions into handle access
